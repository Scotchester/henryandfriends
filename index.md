Henry and his friends lost their homes during the Eaton Fire that started on January 8th and spread out to Altadena, California. They are left with the devastating reality of having lost everything they knew and loved. The safety of their bedroom, the toys they received for Christmas, the backyard they used to play in. We are setting up this webpage for the sake of our kids and their future. We're reaching out humbly for help during this unimaginable time. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for standing with us through this heartbreak. Your kindness reminds us that even in the darkest times, we are not alone.

The webpage is under construction and we'll update it daily. Please bear with us while we add all the information.

## How Can I help?
There are many ways to help Henry and his friends.

### Amazon Wishlist
We set up a wishlist of toys, books, games, clothes and craft items of various prices on Amazon that will be shipped to a shared warehouse. We will keep track of all the items and share them equally among the kids based on their needs and preferences.

Here is the list. Feel free to share it around you.

### Resharing their story
